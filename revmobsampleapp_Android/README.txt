buzztouch for Android

Getting Started - YOU MUST HAVE ECLIPSE TO USE THIS SOFTWARE. The Android Software Developer
Kit (SDK) is also necessary. Eclipse and Android work together to compile your program.

You should have downloaded a .zip archive containing several files and multiple sub-directories. 
You'll need these files when you create your Android project using Eclipse.
Use the instructions.pdf file included with this download to get started.

COMPILE PROJECT USING GOOGLE API's 2.2 Libraries (API Level 8). These libraries
are different than Android 2.2 See the instructions.pdf included in this download
for more information.

Your Eclipse / Android AVD must have the Google Cloud Messaging for Android Library installed. 
This library is found in the "Extras" dialogue in the Android AVD.

IMPORTANT CHANGE ABOUT IMAGE FILE NAMES
#########################################################################

ECLIPSE ONLY ALLOWS LOWER CASE LETTERS IN IMAGE NAMES. This means the images you add to
the /res/drawable directory must have lower-case file names. This also means that all the images
named in your control panel must also have lower case file names.
